    description: `Blog API was developed with Nodejs, Express, and  Mongoose; Nodejs is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build server-side applications. \n\
    Express is a Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js. It provides a set of features and tools to build robust APIs quickly and easily. 
    Express simplifies routing, middleware integration, and request/response handling. 
    Also, NoSQL database was used for storing and retrieving the data from the database, that’s why Mongoose came in handy; accepting the fact that MongoDB validation, casting, and business logic boilerplate can be daunting to write, that’s why Mongoose saved us from unnecessary hassle
    With the use Swagger Editor, help us to be  able to create and document the API for easy usage by both non-techy individuals and mostly Frontend developer that will be consuming the API according to OpenAPI specification.
